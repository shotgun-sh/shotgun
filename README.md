**Shotgun is a CLI tool** that generates codebase-aware specs for AI coding agents like Cursor, Claude Code, and Lovable. **It reads your entire repository**, researches how new features should fit your architecture, and produces technical specifications that keep AI agents on track—so they build what you actually want instead of derailing halfway through.

It includes research on existing patterns, implementation plans that respect your architecture, and task breakdowns ready to export as **AGENTS.md** files. Each spec is complete enough that your AI agent can work longer and further without losing context or creating conflicts.

# 📦 Installation

> [!WARNING]
> **Upgrading from alpha?** Uninstall the old version first:
> ```bash
> npm uninstall -g @proofs-io/shotgun @proofs-io/shotgun-server
> ```

### 1. Install uv

Shotgun runs via `uvx` or `uv tool install`. First, install `uv` for your platform:

<table>
<tr>
<th>Platform</th>
<th>Installation Command</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>macOS</strong> (Homebrew)</td>
<td>

```bash
brew install uv
```
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>macOS/Linux</strong> (curl)</td>
<td>

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Windows</strong> (PowerShell)</td>
<td>

```powershell
powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"       
```
</td>
</tr>
</table>

_💡 Restart your terminal after installation_

### 2. Run Shotgun

<table>
<tr>
<th>🚀 Try It Out (Ephemeral)</th>
<th>⚡ Regular Use (Permanent)</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
  
**Best for:** Testing Shotgun first

```bash
uvx shotgun-sh@latest    
```

No installation needed, runs immediately

</td>
<td>

**Best for:** Daily use

```bash
uv tool install shotgun-sh       
```

Then run anywhere: ``` shotgun ```

</td>
</tr>
</table>

_**Why uv?** It's 10-100x faster than pip and handles binary wheels reliably—no cmake/build tool errors._

### 3. Get Started

When you launch Shotgun, it will guide you through:

| Step | What Happens |
|------|--------------|
| **1. Codebase Indexing** | Builds a searchable graph of your entire repository |
| **2. LLM Setup** | Configure OpenAI, Anthropic, or Gemini |
| **3. First Research** | Start generating codebase-aware specs |

_**💡 Pro tip:** Run Shotgun in your IDE's terminal for the best experience._

---

# 🎯 Usage

Shotgun guides you through **5 phases** that turn ideas into implementation-ready specs with full codebase understanding.

### The 5-Phase Workflow

<table>
<tr>
<th width="15%">Mode</th>
<th width="40%">What It Does</th>
<th width="45%">Command</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><strong>1️⃣ Research</strong></td>
<td>
Searches your codebase and the web to understand what exists, find patterns, and identify constraints before you write anything.
</td>
<td>

```bash
shotgun research "add real-time collaboration"
```
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><strong>2️⃣ Specify</strong></td>
<td>
Creates technical specifications based on research findings, aware of your existing architecture and patterns.
</td>
<td>

```bash
shotgun spec "Add OAuth2 authentication"
```
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><strong>3️⃣ Plan</strong></td>
<td>
Generates implementation plans that respect your codebase structure, dependencies, and discovered constraints.
</td>
<td>

```bash
shotgun plan "Build user dashboard"
```
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><strong>4️⃣ Tasks</strong></td>
<td>
Breaks down the plan into dependency-aware, actionable tasks with clear sequencing and priorities.
</td>
<td>

```bash
shotgun tasks "Implement payment system"
```
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><strong>5️⃣ Export</strong></td>
<td>
Exports specs and tasks as <code>AGENTS.md</code> files formatted for Cursor, Claude Code, Windsurf, or Lovable.
</td>
<td>

```bash
shotgun export
```
</td>
</tr>
</table>

**Result:** Your AI coding agent now has complete context—what exists, why decisions were made, and exactly what to build.

### Quick Mode Switching

**Navigate between phases instantly using `Shift+Tab`** or by running the phase command directly.

_**💡 Visual indicator:** Shotgun's CLI shows your current phase at the bottom of the screen._

# ✨ Features

### What Makes Shotgun Different

<table>
<tr>
<th width="25%">Feature</th>
<th width="35%">Shotgun</th>
<th width="40%">Other Tools</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><strong>Codebase Understanding</strong></td>
<td>
Reads your <strong>entire repository</strong> before generating specs. Finds existing patterns, dependencies, and architecture.
</td>
<td>
Require manual context or search each time. No persistent understanding of your codebase structure.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><strong>Research Phase</strong></td>
<td>
Starts with research—discovers what you already have AND what exists externally before writing anything.
</td>
<td>
Start at specification. Build first, discover problems later.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><strong>Multi-Agent Coordination</strong></td>
<td>
15+ specialized agents work in parallel (research, security, architecture) with coordinated outputs.
</td>
<td>
Single-agent or one-size-fits-all prompts.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><strong>Structured Workflow</strong></td>
<td>
5-phase journey with checkpoints: Research → Spec → Plan → Tasks → Export
</td>
<td>
No structure. Just "prompt and hope."
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><strong>Export Formats</strong></td>
<td>
<code>AGENTS.md</code> files ready for Cursor, Claude Code, Windsurf, Lovable—your choice of tool.
</td>
<td>
Locked into specific IDE or coding agent.
</td>
</tr>

### Why It Matters

**The Problem:** AI coding agents are fast at generating code but have no idea what you already built or why past decisions were made.

**The Solution:** Shotgun gives AI agents the full picture—your codebase context, architectural patterns, and research findings—so they build what you actually need instead of creating conflicts.

# Use Cases

- **🚀 Onboarding** - New developer? Shotgun maps your entire architecture and generates docs that actually match the code
- **🔧 Refactoring** - Understand all dependencies before touching anything. Keep your refactor from becoming a rewrite
- **🌱 Greenfield Projects** - Research existing solutions globally before writing line one
- **➕ Adding Features** - Know exactly where your feature fits. Prevent duplicate functionality
- **📦 Migration** - Map the old, plan the new, track the delta. Break migration into safe stages

# FAQ

**Q: Does Shotgun collect any stats or data?**

A: We only gather minimal, anonymous events (e.g., install, server start, tool call). We don't collect the content itself—only that an event occurred. We use Sentry for error reporting to improve stability.

**Q: Local LLMs?**

A: Planned. We'll publish compatibility notes and local provider integrations.

**Q: What LLM providers are supported?**

A: Currently OpenAI, Anthropic (Claude), and Google Gemini. Local LLM support is on the roadmap.

**Q: Can I use Shotgun offline?**

A: You need an internet connection for LLM API calls, but your codebase stays local.

**Q: How does the code graph work?**

A: Shotgun indexes your codebase using tree-sitter for accurate parsing and creates a searchable graph of your code structure, dependencies, and relationships.
